## 🗂️ Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## 📃 Description
For our CMSC12 final project, our group developed a GUI-based game application in Java using the object-oriented paradigm. The game is a recreation of the classic Space Impact, reimagined in the context of a computer malware invasion.
